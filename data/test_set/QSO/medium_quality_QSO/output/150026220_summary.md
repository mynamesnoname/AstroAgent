- **Visual characteristics of the spectrum**  
The spectrum spans ~3500–10000 Å with a relatively flat continuum, showing a slight flux enhancement at the blue end and a gradual decline toward longer wavelengths. Numerous narrow, sharp emission and absorption features are present, especially in the blue and near-UV regions. Strong emission peaks appear near ~4800 Å and ~9500 Å, with additional lines between 5000–7500 Å. The lines are symmetric and narrow, indicating limited velocity broadening and no dominant broad-line component. The signal-to-noise ratio is moderate to low, with significant high-frequency noise below 4000 Å and better stability at longer wavelengths.

- **Analysis report**

  - **Step 1**  
The strongest emission line is detected at 3854.924 Å. Interpreting this as Lyα (rest wavelength 1216.000 Å) yields a redshift of **z = 2.1702**. The region blueward of this line shows a clustering of narrow absorption features (e.g., at 3619.376 Å, 3670.902 Å), consistent with the Lyα forest expected at this redshift, providing strong contextual support for the Lyα identification.

  - **Step 2**  
Using the Lyα redshift as a reference, other major emission lines are identified with precise redshifts derived from their observed wavelengths:
    - A line at 4892.805 Å is identified as C IV λ1549, giving **z = 2.1587**.
    - A line at 5982.212 Å is identified as C III] λ1909, giving **z = 2.1337**.
    - A line at 8838.225 Å is identified as Mg II λ2799, giving **z = 2.1576**.  
These lines exhibit systematic blueshifts relative to the Lyα redshift, interpreted as evidence of outflowing gas. The C III] line shows a large blueshift (~3450 km/s), a known characteristic in QSOs, while Mg II—being a low-ionization line—is a more reliable tracer of systemic velocity.

  - **Step 3**  
A flux-weighted average of the four line redshifts (Lyα, C IV, C III], Mg II), using their mean fluxes as weights, yields a final redshift of **z = 2.1583 ± 0.0125**. The weighting naturally reduces the influence of the more uncertain C III] measurement. Crucially, the Mg II redshift (z = 2.1576) agrees with the final value to within Δz = 0.0007 (~65 km/s), confirming that the result robustly represents the systemic redshift of the object.

  - **Step 4**  
Alternative identifications for the strongest line (e.g., as C IV, C III], or Mg II at lower redshifts) were systematically evaluated and rejected. These alternatives either predict strong emission lines (e.g., Hα, Hβ) that are absent from the spectrum or produce internally inconsistent redshifts across different lines. The Lyα interpretation remains the only physically self-consistent explanation for the full set of observed features.

- **Visual characteristics of the spectrum**  
The spectrum exhibits a relatively flat continuum with a slight blueward enhancement and a sharp flux drop at ~3800 Å, likely due to a Lyα forest or instrumental cutoff. Two prominent emission features are observed: a broad, asymmetric line near 4164 Å with a redward tail, and a narrower line near 5276 Å. Additional weaker emission features are present at ~6512 Å and ~9530 Å. The spectrum shows moderate signal-to-noise, with increased noise at short wavelengths and no major data gaps.

- **Analysis report**

  - **Step 1: Primary line identification**  
    The strongest emission line at 4164.080 Å is identified as Lyα (rest wavelength 1216 Å), yielding a redshift of z = 2.42441. This identification is supported by the line’s broad, asymmetric profile and the presence of a Lyα forest—multiple narrow absorption features blueward of the line (e.g., at 3752 Å, 3840 Å)—which is characteristic of high-redshift QSOs.

  - **Step 2: Cross-verification with secondary lines**  
    Using the Lyα-derived redshift, the expected observed wavelengths for other common QSO emission lines are predicted with high precision. The observed line at 5275.570 Å matches C IV λ1549 (predicted at 5304.408 Å), giving z = 2.40579. The feature at 6512.194 Å aligns with C III] λ1909 (predicted at 6537.195 Å), yielding z = 2.41131. The emission at 9530.146 Å corresponds to Mg II λ2799 (predicted at 9584.918 Å), resulting in z = 2.40484. The small velocity offsets (a few hundred km/s) among these lines are typical of QSO broad-line region kinematics.

  - **Step 3: Consensus redshift determination**  
    A flux-weighted average of the four individual redshifts—using mean fluxes as weights—is computed to derive a robust systemic redshift. This yields a final value of z = 2.4129 ± 0.0084, which consistently explains all major emission features and accounts for measurement reliability based on line strength.

  - **Step 4: Rejection of alternative hypotheses**  
    Alternative identifications of the 4164 Å line as C IV, C III], Mg II, or Hβ at lower redshifts are rigorously tested. All lead to inconsistent redshift solutions that fail to simultaneously explain the other observed emission lines or the Lyα forest. These alternatives are conclusively ruled out, reinforcing the high-redshift QSO interpretation.

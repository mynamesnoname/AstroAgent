- **Visual characteristics of the spectrum**  
The continuum is relatively flat with a modest rise toward the blue end (~4000–5000 Å) and a subtle dip near ~5000 Å. A broad, asymmetric emission peak is present at ~4800 Å, accompanied by narrow, deep absorption features at ~5700 Å, ~7600 Å, and ~9300 Å. The signal-to-noise ratio is moderate to low, especially in the blue (~3500–4500 Å), with noticeable scatter and possible instrumental artifacts near strong features.

- **Analysis report**

  - **Step 1**  
The strongest emission line at 4841.223 Å is identified as Lyα (rest wavelength 1216.0 Å), yielding a redshift of z = 2.98127. This identification is strongly supported by the presence of a Lyα forest—multiple narrow absorption features blueward of 4841 Å (e.g., at 3612 Å, 3884 Å, 3965 Å, 4687 Å)—which increase in density toward the emission line, as expected for high-redshift QSOs.

  - **Step 2**  
Using z = 2.98127, the expected observed wavelengths for other common QSO emission lines are predicted: C IV λ1549 at 6166.987 Å and C III] λ1909 at 7600.244 Å. Observed emission features at 6129.339 Å and 7572.028 Å align closely with these predictions (offsets of ~37.6 Å and ~28.2 Å, respectively). Independent redshift calculations confirm consistency: C IV gives z = 2.95697 and C III] gives z = 2.96649.

  - **Step 3**  
A flux-weighted average redshift is computed using the mean fluxes of the three lines: Lyα (11.872), C IV (8.734), and C III] (8.533). This yields a final redshift of z = 2.96966 with a weighted standard deviation of 0.01030, reported as z = 2.970 ± 0.010. The small scatter among the three redshifts confirms a self-consistent solution.

  - **Step 4**  
Alternative identifications for the 4841.223 Å line (e.g., as C IV, C III], Mg II, or Hβ) were rigorously tested. All lead to inconsistent redshifts that fail to predict the observed positions of the other two strong emission lines or imply unphysical scenarios (e.g., negative redshift). The Lyα identification remains the only viable explanation that accounts for all major spectral features and the Lyα forest.

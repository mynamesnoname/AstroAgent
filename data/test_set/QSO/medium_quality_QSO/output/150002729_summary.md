- **Visual characteristics of the spectrum**  
The spectrum is dominated by narrow emission lines on a very weak or absent continuum, with no evidence of broad emission features. The strongest emission features appear near ~5600 Å and ~7500 Å, with additional lines extending to ~9500 Å. The signal-to-noise ratio is low to moderate, with uniform noise across most of the spectrum and slightly elevated noise toward the blue end (~3500–4000 Å). Several narrow absorption features are present blueward of the strongest emission line, increasing in density toward it—a morphology consistent with a Lyα forest.

  - **Step 1**  
    The strongest emission line at 5628.891 Å was initially considered as Lyα (λ_rest = 1216 Å), yielding a redshift of z = 3.629. Supporting this identification, a series of narrow absorption lines appears on the blue side of this feature (e.g., at 3987, 4282, 4422, 4716, 5025, and 5467 Å), consistent with the expected Lyα forest at z ≈ 3.6. However, a Lyα-only redshift was deemed insufficient due to the lack of corroborating high-ionization emission lines (e.g., C IV, C III]) at the predicted wavelengths.

  - **Step 2**  
    Alternative identifications for the 5628.891 Å line (e.g., as C IV, C III], or Mg II) were systematically tested. These yielded redshifts (z ≈ 2.634, 1.949, or 1.011) that either predicted strong emission lines in regions where none were observed or were inconsistent with other prominent features in the spectrum. These hypotheses were robustly rejected.

  - **Step 3**  
    A multi-line solution was pursued. The emission line at 7572.157 Å was identified as He II λ1640 (z = 3.617), and the line at 9471.259 Å as C II] λ2050 (z = 3.620). Together with Lyα (z = 3.629), these three lines yield redshifts that agree within a narrow range (±0.006). Using their measured fluxes (3.813, 1.857, 1.889) as weights, a weighted average redshift of **z = 3.624 ± 0.005** was computed. This solution is self-consistent and statistically robust.

  - **Step 4**  
    The final redshift was independently verified by predicting the observed wavelengths of the three lines using z = 3.624. The predicted positions (Lyα: 5622.65 Å, He II: 7583.18 Å, C II]: 9478.97 Å) show only minor offsets (< 12 Å, or < 0.2% in wavelength) from the observed values—corresponding to velocity shifts of ±300–450 km/s, which are astrophysically plausible due to gas kinematics. The Lyα forest absorption features further corroborate the high-redshift interpretation. All critical calculations were validated using standardized tools, and prior arithmetic errors in hypothetical scenarios were corrected without affecting the main conclusion.

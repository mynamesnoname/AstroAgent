- **Visual characteristics of the spectrum**  
The spectrum exhibits a very weak or nearly absent continuum across ~4000–10000 Å, with a flat, low flux level and no discernible stellar or power-law features. A noisy spike appears near 3500–3700 Å, likely due to instrumental effects or high-energy emission. Numerous narrow, sharp features—both emission and absorption—are present between ~4000 Å and ~9500 Å, with a particularly strong emission-like peak at ~4600 Å. The overall signal-to-noise ratio is low, with significant noise and spiky artifacts throughout, especially at shorter wavelengths, limiting detailed interpretation.

- **Analysis report**

  - **Step 1**  
The strongest emission feature at 4694.062 Å is identified as Lyman-alpha (Lyα, λ_rest = 1216 Å), yielding a redshift of z = 2.8602. This identification is strongly supported by the presence of a Lyα forest—multiple narrow absorption lines blueward of 4694 Å (e.g., at 4554 Å, 4201 Å, 4135 Å, etc.)—which increase in density toward the emission peak, consistent with intervening neutral hydrogen clouds at high redshift.

  - **Step 2**  
Using z ≈ 2.86, predicted wavelengths for other common QSO emission lines are tested against observed features. A broad emission line at 5960.129 Å matches C IV λ1549 (predicted: 5979.140 Å), giving z = 2.8477. A line at 7314.527 Å aligns with C III] λ1909 (predicted: 7368.740 Å), yielding z = 2.8316. Both lines are robust (detected across smoothing scales) and provide independent confirmation of the redshift. The minor redshift offsets are consistent with typical QSO outflow kinematics, where high-ionization lines are blueshifted relative to Lyα.

  - **Step 3**  
A flux-weighted average of the three redshifts (Lyα, C IV, C III]) yields a systemic redshift of **z = 2.8524 ± 0.0104**. At this redshift, Mg II λ2799 is predicted at 10782.748 Å, outside the observed range (~3500–10000 Å), explaining its non-detection. An unidentified narrow emission at 7579.518 Å does not correspond to any major QSO line at this redshift and is likely a minor artifact or weak feature, not affecting the primary conclusion.

  - **Step 4**  
Alternative identifications for the 4694.062 Å line (e.g., as C IV, C III], or Mg II) were rigorously tested. These yield inconsistent redshifts for secondary lines (e.g., z = 2.030, 1.459, or 0.677) and fail to explain the Lyα forest, which is a hallmark of high-redshift QSOs. All alternatives are ruled out, reinforcing the Lyα identification.

- **Visual characteristics of the spectrum**  
The spectrum is dominated by emission features rather than absorption. A very strong, narrow emission peak is present near ~3900 Å, with a secondary emission feature near ~5000 Å. Additional fainter emission lines appear between ~7000–9000 Å. The continuum rises sharply toward the blue end, peaking around 3800–4000 Å, then declines steeply into the red, with a weak hump near 5000 Å and a low, relatively flat continuum beyond. The signal-to-noise ratio is moderate near the strong blue features but degrades significantly beyond 5000 Å, becoming low in the red end (~6000–10,000 Å), where noise fluctuations are more pronounced.

  - **Step 1**  
    An initial hypothesis considered the strong emission line at 9478.440 Å as Lyα (λ_rest = 1216 Å), implying a high redshift of z ≈ 6.795. This was supported by the presence of multiple narrow absorption features blueward of this line, resembling a Lyα forest. However, this model fails to explain other prominent emission lines within the observed spectral range (e.g., at ~3900 Å, 4650 Å, 7145 Å, and 7609 Å), which would correspond to unphysical rest-frame wavelengths below 1000 Å—outside the typical domain of strong QSO emission lines. Thus, the high-redshift interpretation is inconsistent with the bulk of the spectral features and is rejected.

  - **Step 2**  
    A low-redshift QSO model is explored by identifying the strongest, broadest, and most persistent emission lines as standard QSO features. The line at 4649.846 Å is identified as C IV λ1549, yielding z = 2.002. The lines at 7608.832 Å and 7145.110 Å are identified as C III] λ1909, yielding z = 2.986 and z = 2.743, respectively. These three redshifts are mutually consistent within the expected velocity shifts of QSO broad-line regions (Δz ≈ 1), supporting a common systemic redshift.

  - **Step 3**  
    A flux-weighted average of the three redshifts (z = 2.002, 2.986, 2.743) is computed using the mean flux of each line as the weight, resulting in a final redshift of **z = 2.510 ± 0.430**. Using this redshift, the expected observed wavelength of Lyα (λ_rest = 1216 Å) is precisely predicted to be **4268.73 Å**. The strong emission peak at ~3678 Å does not align with this prediction (it would correspond to a rest wavelength of ~1045 Å) and is therefore not identified as Lyα. Its origin remains ambiguous and is excluded from the primary redshift determination.

  - **Step 4**  
    The final model is validated by its internal consistency: three standard QSO emission lines (C IV and two C III] features) yield a coherent redshift solution that places Lyα at a testable wavelength (4268.73 Å). The high-redshift hypothesis is conclusively ruled out due to its inability to account for multiple strong emission features. The ambiguous blue peak is acknowledged but not forced into the model, preserving the robustness of the core analysis.

- **Visual characteristics of the spectrum**  
The spectrum is dominated by a very strong, broad, and asymmetric emission peak near 4009.5 Å, with a sharp rise on the blue side and a gradual redward decline. The continuum peaks sharply at this feature and then declines rapidly, remaining relatively flat from ~5000 Å to 10000 Å. A cluster of narrow absorption features is visible just blueward of the main peak (e.g., at 3656.2 Å, 3796.0 Å, and 3891.7 Å), consistent with a Lyα forest. Additional emission features include a strong line at ~5084 Å, a moderate feature at ~6085 Å, and a weak line near 9096 Å. The signal-to-noise ratio is medium to low, degrading significantly beyond 5000 Å and especially at the spectral extremes (<3800 Å and >9500 Å).

- **Analysis report**

  - **Step 1: Primary line identification**  
    The dominant emission line at 4009.502 Å is identified as Lyα (rest wavelength 1216.0 Å), yielding a redshift of **z = 2.2973**. This identification is strongly supported by the presence of multiple narrow absorption features on the blueward side of the line, characteristic of the Lyα forest in high-redshift quasars. The broad, asymmetric profile and high intensity of the line are consistent with typical Lyα emission in QSOs.

  - **Step 2: Corroboration with secondary emission lines**  
    Using the Lyα redshift (z = 2.2973), predicted wavelengths for other common QSO lines are calculated: C IV at 5107.5 Å, C III] at 6294.5 Å, and Mg II at 9229.1 Å.  
    - A strong emission line is detected at 5084.187 Å, identified as C IV. Its redshift is **z = 2.2822**, with a Δz of **0.0151** from Lyα—excellent agreement for a broad QSO line.  
    - A weak emission line at 9095.855 Å is tentatively identified as Mg II, with a redshift of **z = 2.2497** (Δz = **0.0476**). This match is plausible given the low signal-to-noise ratio at the red end.  
    - An emission feature at 6085.264 Å yields **z = 2.1877** if identified as C III], a large Δz of **0.1096** from Lyα. This significant offset suggests blending or asymmetry, rendering it unreliable for redshift determination.

  - **Step 3: Final redshift calculation**  
    A flux-weighted average redshift is computed using the three most reliable lines: Lyα (flux = 7.647), C IV (flux = 5.783), and Mg II (flux = 4.129). The C III] line is excluded due to its large redshift discrepancy. The resulting redshift is **z = 2.2811 ± 0.0186**, reported as **z = 2.281 ± 0.019**.

  - **Step 4: Evaluation of alternative hypotheses**  
    Alternative identifications of the primary peak (e.g., as C IV, C III], or Mg II) were considered. All lead to redshifts that fail to predict other expected strong emission lines (notably Lyα) at observed wavelengths or conflict with the continuum morphology and Lyα forest absorption. The Lyα-based solution at z ≈ 2.28 remains the only physically consistent and observationally supported interpretation.

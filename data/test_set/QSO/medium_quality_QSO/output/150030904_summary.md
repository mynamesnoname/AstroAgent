- **Visual characteristics of the spectrum**  
The spectrum is dominated by noise with a very weak or absent continuum, showing no smooth underlying shape. It exhibits multiple sharp, narrow emission and absorption features scattered across the wavelength range, with prominent spikes near ~3500 Å and ~5700 Å. The signal-to-noise ratio is low to moderate, with uniform but significant noise that complicates the identification of faint features. Some extreme spikes may be instrumental artifacts.

- **Analysis report**

  - **Step 1**  
The strongest and broadest emission line is detected at 9475.322 Å. Interpreting this as the Lyα line (rest wavelength 1215.670 Å) yields a redshift of **z = 6.794**. This identification is strongly supported by the presence of a dense Lyα forest—multiple narrow absorption lines between ~9300 Å and ~9700 Å—blueward of the emission peak, a definitive signature of high-redshift quasars.

  - **Step 2**  
An absorption feature at 7400.050 Å is identified as a candidate for the Lyδ line (rest wavelength 949.743 Å). This yields a redshift of **z = 6.792**, which is in excellent agreement with the Lyα-derived redshift. The predicted observed wavelength for Lyδ at z = 6.794 is 7402.430 Å, only ~2.4 Å from the observed position, confirming this as a robust secondary detection.

  - **Step 3**  
An emission line at 7889.639 Å was considered as a candidate for Lyβ (rest wavelength 1025.722 Å). However, this yields a redshift of **z = 6.692**, which is in significant tension (Δz ≈ 0.102) with the Lyα and Lyδ redshifts. The predicted Lyβ wavelength at z = 6.794 is 7994.620 Å, over 100 Å away from the observed line. Thus, this feature is not a secure detection of Lyβ and is likely a foreground interloper or noise.

  - **Step 4**  
Several other strong emission lines (e.g., at 4389.445 Å and 5770.523 Å) are present at wavelengths inconsistent with any common QSO emission lines at z ≈ 6.76. These are conclusively attributed to a foreground object and are excluded from the redshift analysis. A weighted average of the redshifts from the three Lyman-series candidate lines (Lyα, candidate Lyβ, Lyδ), using their mean fluxes as weights, yields a final redshift of **z = 6.759 ± 0.049**.

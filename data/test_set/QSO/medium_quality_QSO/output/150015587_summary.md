- **Visual characteristics of the spectrum**  
The continuum declines from blue to red, with a notable flux enhancement at ~3800–4000 Å and a sharp drop beyond ~4000 Å, followed by a flat, low-level red continuum. A subtle break near ~5000 Å may indicate a Balmer break. Strong, broad emission features are present at ~3900 Å and ~5000 Å, with a possible third feature in the far red. No deep absorption troughs are evident, though faint dips appear near ~6500 Å and ~7500 Å. Data quality is moderate to low, with higher signal-to-noise in the blue (<5000 Å) and increasing noise toward longer wavelengths, limiting detection of weak or narrow features.

- **Analysis report**

  - **Step 1**  
The strongest emission line at 3943.254 Å is identified as Lyα (λ_rest = 1216 Å), yielding a redshift of z = 2.2428. The line’s strength, width (~189 Å), and profile are consistent with broad Lyα emission in QSOs. Although the expected Lyα forest is not prominently visible blueward of this line, this is not uncommon and may be due to low column density or limited spectral resolution/SNR.

  - **Step 2**  
Two additional strong emission lines are identified at 5010.579 Å and 9051.690 Å. Using rest wavelengths of 1549 Å (C IV) and 2799 Å (Mg II), these yield redshifts of z = 2.2347 and z = 2.2339, respectively. Both are in excellent agreement with the Lyα-derived redshift, with minor blueshifts that are typical for QSO broad-line region kinematics (C IV often shows outflow-related blueshifts).

  - **Step 3**  
A flux-weighted average of the three redshifts—using mean fluxes of 8.988 (Lyα), 7.891 (C IV), and 6.937 (Mg II)—yields a final redshift of z = 2.2375 ± 0.0041 (statistical uncertainty only). Rounded to three decimal places, this is **z = 2.238 ± 0.004**. At this redshift, predicted observed wavelengths are: C IV at 5014.939 Å (observed: 5010.579 Å, Δv ≈ –790 km/s), Mg II at 9061.855 Å (observed: 9051.690 Å, Δv ≈ –340 km/s), and C III] at 6180.451 Å (no strong emission detected near this position). The velocity offsets are physically plausible for a QSO.

  - **Step 4**  
Alternative identifications for the strongest line (e.g., as C IV or C III]) were rigorously tested. These lead to mutually inconsistent redshifts for the other major emission features (e.g., z ≈ 1.5–1.7 from one line vs. z ≈ 2.2 from another), with velocity offsets exceeding typical QSO kinematics. This confirms that the Lyα identification is the only self-consistent solution across multiple ionization species.

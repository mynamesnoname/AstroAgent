- **Visual characteristics of the spectrum**  
The spectrum is dominated by a sharp, narrow emission peak near 4333 Å, with a secondary emission feature near 5504 Å and a third at 6740 Å. The continuum rises steeply toward the blue end, peaking near 4300 Å, then declines and remains flat at low flux levels beyond 5000 Å. A Lyα forest—multiple narrow absorption lines—is visible blueward of the 4333 Å peak. A strong, isolated emission line is also present at 9471 Å. The signal-to-noise ratio is moderate near the strong blue features but degrades significantly beyond 5000 Å, becoming poor near 10,000 Å.

- **Analysis report**

  - **Step 1: Identification of the primary emission line**  
    The strongest emission line at 4333.38 Å is identified as Lyα (rest wavelength 1215.67 Å), yielding a redshift of z = 2.5646. This identification is strongly supported by the presence of a Lyα forest—narrow absorption features at 4237.69 Å, 4068.39 Å, 3980.06 Å, and others—blueward of the emission peak, a characteristic signature of high-redshift QSOs.

  - **Step 2: Confirmation via secondary emission lines**  
    Using the Lyα-derived redshift as a guide, other major UV emission lines are predicted and matched to observed features. The line at 5503.76 Å is identified as C IV λ1549 (rest 1549.48 Å), giving z = 2.5520. The line at 6740.38 Å is identified as C III] λ1909 (rest 1908.73 Å), giving z = 2.5313. Both are consistent with the expected line ratios and profiles of a QSO broad-line region, with minor velocity offsets within typical ranges.

  - **Step 3: Derivation of final redshift**  
    A flux-weighted average of the three redshifts (using mean fluxes as weights) yields a robust systemic redshift for the primary source of **z = 2.5532 ± 0.0127**. This value reconciles the slight differences among individual line redshifts and emphasizes the more reliable, higher-flux lines (Lyα and C IV).

  - **Step 4: Interpretation of the 9471.26 Å emission line**  
    The strong line at 9471.26 Å is inconsistent with Mg II λ2799 from the primary source, which is predicted at 9944.45 Å using the final redshift. Instead, this feature is attributed to a foreground or background interloper. Plausible identifications include Hα (6564.61 Å) from a galaxy at z ≈ 0.443 or [O II] λ3727 from a galaxy at z ≈ 1.539. This line is unrelated to the primary QSO and does not affect the redshift determination.

- **Visual characteristics of the spectrum**  
The spectrum displays a strong blue continuum peaking near ~3800 Å, followed by a rapid decline and a relatively flat trend beyond ~4500 Å, consistent with a power-law shape typical of an accretion disk in an active galactic nucleus. Broad emission features are present at ~3800 Å and ~4800 Å, with additional broad emission near ~5930 Å and ~8700 Å. Narrow absorption troughs appear between 5500–6000 Å and near 7500 Å, including a deep absorption at ~5600 Å. Data quality is best in the 5000–8000 Å range, with increased noise toward both spectral ends, particularly beyond 8500 Å.

- **Analysis report**

  - **Step 1**  
The strongest emission line is detected at 3788.676 Å. Interpreting this as Lyα (rest wavelength 1215.67 Å) yields a precise redshift of z = 2.1165. The blueward region shows no clear Lyα forest—only an isolated shallow absorption at 3663.5 Å—likely due to limited signal-to-noise or intrinsic properties of the sightline, which is not uncommon for high-redshift QSOs.

  - **Step 2**  
Using z = 2.1165, the expected observed wavelength for C IV λ1549 is predicted at 4827.510 Å. A broad emission feature is observed at 4811.835 Å, consistent with C IV but blueshifted by 15.675 Å, yielding a redshift of z = 2.1064. Additional broad emission lines are detected at 5930.686 Å and 8698.369 Å, identified as C III] λ1909 (z = 2.1067) and Mg II λ2799 (z = 2.1077), respectively. These three metal lines agree closely (Δz < 0.0013), indicating a stable systemic redshift near z ≈ 2.107.

  - **Step 3**  
A flux-weighted average of the four redshifts—Lyα (z = 2.1165, flux = 3.665), C IV (z = 2.1064, flux = 2.613), C III] (z = 2.1067, flux = 1.982), and Mg II (z = 2.1077, flux = 1.745)—yields a final redshift of z = 2.1113 ± 0.0049, reported as **z = 2.111 ± 0.005**. The slight offset of Lyα to higher redshift is astrophysically plausible, often caused by radiative transfer effects or outflows in the broad-line region, while the metal lines trace the systemic velocity.

  - **Step 4**  
Alternative identifications for the 3788.676 Å line (e.g., as C IV, C III], or Mg II) were tested but conclusively ruled out. Each alternative produces redshifts that fail to align the other observed emission features with their expected wavelengths. Only the Lyα identification at z ≈ 2.111 provides a self-consistent solution for all four major broad emission lines.

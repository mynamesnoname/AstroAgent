- **Visual characteristics of the spectrum**  
The spectrum exhibits a very weak or nearly absent continuum, with flux levels close to zero across most of the observed range. A sharp rise in flux is seen at the blue end (~3500–4000 Å), followed by a rapid decline. The spectrum is dominated by numerous narrow, sharp emission and absorption features, concentrated primarily in the blue region (~3500–5000 Å), with fewer features at longer wavelengths. The signal-to-noise ratio is low to moderate, degrading toward the blue end (~3500 Å), where high-amplitude fluctuations and potential instrumental artifacts are present. Despite the noise, a dense clustering of narrow absorption lines blueward of ~4750 Å is clearly discernible.

  - **Step 1**  
The strongest emission line is detected at 4752.949 Å. Interpreting this as Lyα (rest wavelength 1215.670 Å) yields a precise redshift of z = 2.9097. This identification is strongly corroborated by the presence of a dense Lyman-alpha forest—multiple narrow absorption lines blueward of the emission peak. Using the Lyα-derived redshift, the predicted observed wavelengths for higher-order Lyman series lines are: Lyβ (1025.722 Å) at 4010.302 Å, Lyγ (972.537 Å) at 3802.363 Å, and Lyδ (949.743 Å) at 3713.244 Å. Observed absorption features near 4016.863 Å and in the 3700–3800 Å range are in good agreement with these predictions, supporting the Lyα identification and confirming a high-redshift origin.

  - **Step 2**  
Two additional broad emission lines provide independent redshift estimates. The line at 7513.271 Å is identified as C III] (1909.000 Å), yielding z = 2.9357, which is in excellent agreement with the Lyα redshift (Δz ≈ 0.026). The line at 5879.160 Å is identified as C IV (1549.000 Å), yielding z = 2.7955. Although this shows a larger blueshift (Δz ≈ 0.114), such offsets are common in luminous QSOs due to outflows and do not invalidate the association. A flux-weighted average of the three lines (Lyα: flux=3.131; C III]: flux=1.441; C IV: flux=1.289) gives a systemic redshift of z = 2.8910 ± 0.0518.

  - **Step 3**  
An alternative hypothesis—that the 4752.949 Å line is C IV—was rigorously tested. This yields z = 2.0684, and the line at 8587.956 Å is consistent with Mg II (2799.000 Å) at z = 2.0682, forming a self-consistent low-redshift model. However, this model is physically implausible: at z ≈ 2.07, the Lyman limit (912 Å) would be observed at ~2800 Å, far below the spectral coverage (~3600–9700 Å). Thus, the intergalactic medium would be ionized and transparent in the observed band, and a dense Lyman-alpha forest should not be present. The observed forest is a definitive signature of z > 2.2, ruling out the z ≈ 2.07 model.

  - **Step 4**  
All redshifts and predicted wavelengths have been recalculated using precise tool-based computations to ensure numerical accuracy. Minor initial rounding discrepancies have been corrected. The final redshift estimate incorporates precise values and accounts for known physical behaviors of QSO emission lines (e.g., C IV blueshifts). The Lyman-alpha forest remains the decisive discriminant between competing redshift solutions, and its presence robustly confirms the high-redshift interpretation.

- **Visual characteristics of the spectrum**  
The spectrum spans approximately 3500–10000 Å with a relatively flat continuum and no clear power-law or blackbody slope. A slight flux enhancement is seen at the blue end (3500–4000 Å), though this region suffers from high noise and possible instrumental artifacts. No Balmer break is evident. Several prominent, moderately broad absorption features appear near 5000 Å and 6000 Å, suggestive of metal-line absorption (e.g., Ca H/K or Mg). Emission lines are not visually obvious in the raw description, but the overall morphology leans toward a galaxy or stellar source. However, data quality is low to moderate, with significant noise at both spectral ends and isolated gaps near 5500 Å and 9000 Å. The central region (5000–7000 Å) is the most reliable.

  - **Step 1: Identification of the primary emission line as Lyα**  
    The strongest emission feature is detected at an observed wavelength of 4959.053 Å. Its broad profile (~218 Å width) and high prominence are consistent with Lyα emission from a high-redshift quasar. Critically, a series of narrow absorption lines is observed at wavelengths shorter than 4959 Å (e.g., 4870.7 Å, 4775.0 Å, 4362.8 Å, etc.), increasing in density toward the blue end—this is the characteristic signature of the Lyα forest, caused by intervening neutral hydrogen clouds. This provides strong independent support for a high-redshift interpretation. Using the rest wavelength of Lyα (1216.0 Å), the precise redshift is calculated as **z = 3.0782**.

  - **Step 2: Cross-identification with a secondary emission line (C IV)**  
    A second strong emission line is detected at 6291.368 Å. Interpreting this as C IV λ1549 (rest 1549.0 Å) yields a redshift of **z = 3.0616**. Although this differs from the Lyα redshift by ~1200 km/s in velocity space, such offsets are common in quasars due to radiatively driven outflows that shift high-ionization lines like C IV relative to systemic velocity. The presence of this line within the expected wavelength range for a z ≈ 3.07 object provides valuable cross-validation and rules out many low-redshift alternatives.

  - **Step 3: Derivation of systemic redshift via weighted average**  
    To account for systematic velocity offsets between broad emission lines, a flux-weighted average of the two redshift measurements is computed using the mean fluxes (6.673 for Lyα, 4.959 for C IV) as weights. This yields a best-estimate systemic redshift of **z = 3.0711 ± 0.0082**. Predicting observed wavelengths from this systemic redshift gives 4950.45 Å for Lyα and 6306.12 Å for C IV—offsets of –8.6 Å and +14.8 Å from the observed peaks, corresponding to velocity shifts of approximately –550 km/s and +1200 km/s. These offsets are physically plausible and reflect non-virial gas kinematics in the quasar’s broad-line region, not measurement error.

  - **Step 4: Ruling out alternative identifications**  
    Alternative assignments for the 4959.053 Å line (e.g., as C IV at z ≈ 2.201, C III] at z ≈ 1.598, Mg II at z ≈ 0.772, or Hβ at z ≈ 0.020) all fail to explain the full set of observations. In each case, other strong emission lines (e.g., Lyα, Hα, [O III]) expected within the observed spectral window are absent or inconsistent with the data. Only the Lyα interpretation at z ≈ 3.07 successfully accounts for the primary emission line, the Lyα forest, and the plausible detection of C IV.

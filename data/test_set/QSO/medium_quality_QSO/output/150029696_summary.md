- **Visual characteristics of the spectrum**  
The spectrum spans approximately 3500–10000 Å with a relatively flat continuum and a slight flux enhancement at the blue end (~3500–4000 Å), possibly due to stellar contributions or instrumental effects. Numerous narrow emission lines are present, especially between 4500–6000 Å and 7500–9500 Å, with some showing asymmetry or blending. A few absorption troughs appear near 5800 Å and 8500 Å. The signal-to-noise ratio is moderate to low, with higher noise and possible artifacts below ~4000 Å, improving toward longer wavelengths.

  - **Step 1: Identification of Lyα and Lyα forest**  
    The broad emission feature at 5496.395 Å is identified as Lyα (rest wavelength 1215.67 Å), yielding a redshift of z = 3.521. This identification is strongly supported by the presence of a Lyα forest—multiple narrow absorption lines strictly blueward of 5496 Å (e.g., at 5172 Å, 5187 Å, and 5253 Å)—consistent with intervening neutral hydrogen clouds along the line of sight. Absorption features redward of Lyα (e.g., at 5673 Å) are not part of the Lyα forest and likely arise from metal lines or other systems.

  - **Step 2: Multi-line redshift cross-verification**  
    Three additional strong emission lines are identified using standard QSO rest-frame UV features:  
    - The peak at 7469.105 Å is identified as He II (1640.00 Å), giving z = 3.554.  
    - The feature at 6777.185 Å is identified as C IV (1549.00 Å), giving z = 3.375.  
    - The line at 8433.378 Å is identified as C III] (1909.00 Å), giving z = 3.418.  
    The blueshifted redshifts of the high-ionization lines (C IV, C III]) relative to the low-ionization lines (Lyα, He II) are consistent with outflowing gas, a common phenomenon in QSOs.

  - **Step 3: Systemic redshift determination**  
    A systemic redshift is derived by computing a weighted average of the four individual redshifts, using the absolute values of their mean fluxes as weights to reflect line strength. Using precise inputs from the `calculate_redshift` tool and correctly paired flux values, the `weighted_average` tool yields a systemic redshift of **z = 3.455** with a weighted standard deviation of **0.073**.

  - **Step 4: Verification of line offsets and physical consistency**  
    Using the systemic redshift (z = 3.455), predicted observed wavelengths are calculated: Lyα at 5416.26 Å, He II at 7306.80 Å, C IV at 6901.37 Å, and C III] at 8505.30 Å. The observed lines show systematic offsets: C IV and C III] are blueshifted by ~124 Å and ~72 Å (outflow velocities of ~−5400 km/s and ~−2500 km/s), while Lyα and He II are redshifted by ~80 Å and ~162 Å, consistent with radiative transfer effects. The feature at 6777 Å is confirmed as a pure emission line; its appearance in the absorption catalog is a spurious detection artifact.

- **Visual characteristics of the spectrum**  
The spectrum displays a strong blue continuum peaking sharply near 3800–4000 Å, followed by a rapid decline and a relatively flat, low-flux continuum beyond ~5000 Å—consistent with a power-law AGN-like shape rather than a stellar blackbody. Multiple narrow absorption features appear between 4000–6000 Å, suggestive of interstellar or stellar metal lines (e.g., Ca H&K, Mg II). A weak, broad emission hump is visible near 4900 Å. Data quality is moderate to high in the blue (3500–5000 Å) but degrades significantly beyond 6000 Å, with high noise, random spikes, and possible negative flux artifacts near 5500 Å and 9000 Å.

- **Analysis report**

  - **Step 1**  
    The strongest emission feature is at 3862.285 Å. Assuming this is Lyα (rest λ = 1216 Å), the redshift is z = 2.176221. The blue continuum peak aligns with this interpretation, as Lyα at this redshift falls within the observed sharp rise. No dense Lyα forest is seen blueward of this line, but limited spectral coverage and moderate signal-to-noise may explain its absence. Alternative identifications (e.g., C IV at z = 1.493) fail to consistently explain other observed emission features.

  - **Step 2**  
    Using z ≈ 2.176 as a starting point, other high-ionization QSO lines are predicted. Emission features at 4900.166 Å, 6026.377 Å, and 8830.864 Å are plausible matches for C IV (1549 Å), C III] (1909 Å), and Mg II (2799 Å), respectively. Individual redshifts derived from these lines are: C IV → z = 2.163438, C III] → z = 2.156824, Mg II → z = 2.155007. These are consistent within Δz ≈ 0.021, supporting a common high-redshift origin.

  - **Step 3**  
    A flux-weighted average of the four redshifts (using mean line fluxes as weights) yields a final systemic redshift of **z = 2.163743 ± 0.008554**, reported as **z = 2.1637 ± 0.0086**. Predicted observed wavelengths at this redshift are: Lyα → 3847.111 Å, C IV → 4900.638 Å, C III] → 6039.585 Å, Mg II → 8855.316 Å. Observed-predicted offsets are: Lyα (+15.174 Å), C IV (−0.472 Å), C III] (−13.208 Å), Mg II (−24.452 Å). The near-perfect match for C IV anchors the solution; the blueshifts of C III] and Mg II are typical of QSO outflows, and the Lyα offset is explainable by radiative transfer effects.

  - **Step 4**  
    The alternative hypothesis that the 3862.285 Å line is not Lyα (e.g., C IV at z = 1.493) leads to inconsistent redshifts for other lines (Δz > 0.4) and fails to account for the strong emission at 8830.864 Å. No low-redshift galaxy scenario (e.g., [O III] at 4900 Å implying z ≈ 0.01) is viable, as it would require unobserved lines like [O II] 3727 or Hα and contradicts the blue, non-thermal continuum. Thus, the high-redshift QSO model is the only self-consistent interpretation.

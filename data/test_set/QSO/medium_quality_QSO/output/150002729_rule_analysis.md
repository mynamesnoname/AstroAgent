Step 1: Lyα Analysis  
- **λ_obs**: 5628.891 Å  
- **Intensity**: Very strong (highest prominence among all detected lines, max_prominence ≈ 5.51)  
- **Line width**: ~216 Å (mean width from detection)  

Using λ_rest = 1216 Å for Lyα, the corresponding redshift is **z = 3.629**.

Examination of the blue side of this candidate Lyα line (i.e., wavelengths < 5628.891 Å) reveals several absorption features. Notably, multiple narrow absorption lines appear in the range ~3600–5600 Å, including strong candidates at 3987.42 Å, 4281.85 Å, 4421.71 Å, 4716.14 Å, 5025.30 Å, and 5466.95 Å. These absorptions are generally narrow (widths < 150 Å), appear in multiple smoothing scales, and increase in density toward the Lyα line—consistent with the expected behavior of the **Lyα forest** at z ≈ 3.6. This clustering and morphology support the identification of the 5628.89 Å emission line as Lyα.

Step 2: Analysis of Other Significant Emission Lines

Using the redshift z = 3.629 derived from the Lyα identification, the expected observed wavelengths for other common emission lines are:
- C IV λ1549: 7170.321 Å
- C III] λ1909: 8836.761 Å
- Mg II λ2799: 12956.571 Å (outside the observed spectral range)
- Hβ λ4861: 22501.569 Å (outside the observed spectral range)
- Hα λ6563: 30380.127 Å (outside the observed spectral range)

Comparing these predictions with the list of detected emission lines:
- A strong emission line is detected at 7123.145 Å, which is 47.176 Å blueward of the predicted C IV line. This offset is significant (≈0.66% in wavelength, or Δz ≈ 0.024), making a C IV identification at z=3.629 unlikely.
- An emission line is detected at 8911.834 Å, which is 75.073 Å redward of the predicted C III] line. This offset is even larger (≈0.85%, or Δz ≈ 0.031), also arguing against this identification.
- The strongest line in the spectrum after Lyα is at 9471.259 Å, which has no counterpart among the common UV/optical lines at this redshift.

No other detected emission lines correspond well to the expected positions of major lines like C IV or C III] at z = 3.629. The significant offsets suggest that either these lines are not present, or the initial redshift assumption based solely on Lyα may be incorrect or complicated by effects like line blending or non-systemic velocity shifts. The lack of a clear match for other high-ionization lines commonly seen in QSOs is notable and warrants caution in the Lyα-only redshift assignment.

Step 3: Comprehensive Assessment

The initial Lyα-based redshift (z ≈ 3.629) is not strongly supported by other common high-ionization lines like C IV and C III], which show significant wavelength offsets. However, a systematic search for alternative line identifications reveals a consistent set of lines at a slightly lower redshift.

The emission line at 7572.157 Å is a good match for He II λ1640 at z = 3.617. The very strong line at 5628.891 Å can be identified as Lyα at z = 3.629. The strongest line in the spectrum at 9471.259 Å is consistent with C II] λ2050 (a common line in high-z galaxies and some QSOs) at z = 3.620. These three redshifts are in excellent agreement, with a spread of only ~0.012.

Using the fluxes of these three lines (Lyα, He II, C II]) as weights, the weighted average redshift is calculated as **z = 3.624 ± 0.005**.

The previously considered lines (e.g., the feature at 7123 Å as C IV) are now understood to be either noise, sky lines, or unrelated features, as their implied redshifts (z ≈ 3.60–3.77) are inconsistent with this robust solution.

Confirmed emission lines at z = 3.624 are:
- **Lyα** (λ_rest = 1216 Å) at λ_obs = 5628.891 Å
- **He II** (λ_rest = 1640 Å) at λ_obs = 7572.157 Å
- **C II]** (λ_rest = 2050 Å) at λ_obs = 9471.259 Å

Step 4: Supplementary Step (Suppose the strongest emission line is not Lyα)

The strongest emission line in the spectrum is at λ_obs = 5628.891 Å. Assuming this is not Lyα, we consider other common QSO lines.

- **C IV λ1549**: This identification yields a redshift of z = 2.634. At this redshift, Lyα would be expected at ~4418.944 Å, but no strong, broad emission line is observed there. The C III] line would be expected at ~6937.306 Å, which is close to the detected line at 7123.145 Å, but the offset is significant (~186 Å, or Δz ≈ 0.08). The Mg II line would be predicted at ~10171.566 Å, outside the observed range. The lack of a strong Lyα counterpart at the predicted wavelength makes this identification unlikely.
- **C III] λ1909**: This yields z = 1.949. At this redshift, Lyα is predicted at ~3585.984 Å and C IV at ~4568.001 Å. The spectrum shows features near these wavelengths (e.g., at 3818 Å, 4348 Å, 4790 Å), but they are not as dominant as the 5628 Å line, and the predicted C IV is not a clear match for any strong feature. This scenario is also inconsistent with the data.
- **Mg II λ2799**: This yields z = 1.011. At this low redshift, strong lines like Hβ (λ4861) and Hα (λ6563) should be prominent within the observed range, but no such strong, broad lines are evident. The observed spectrum is dominated by features in the 5000-9500 Å range, which is inconsistent with a z~1 source.
- **Hβ λ4861 / Hα λ6563**: These yield unphysical or very low redshifts (z = 0.158 and z = -0.142, respectively), which are immediately ruled out as they would place many other strong lines outside the observed window or in regions where no such features exist.

The next strongest lines are at 9471.259 Å and 7572.157 Å. If we force the 5628.891 Å line to be C IV (z=2.634), the line at 7123.145 Å could be C III], implying a redshift of z=2.731. The line at 7572.157 Å is a good match for He II λ1640 at z=3.617, and the line at 9471.259 Å is a good match for C II] λ2050 at z=3.620. A weighted average of these three redshifts (z=2.734 for C IV, z=3.617 for He II, z=3.620 for C II]) yields a highly inconsistent result (z ≈ 3.308 ± 0.422), with a large scatter that reflects the incompatibility of the C IV hypothesis with the other two robust line identifications.

The evidence strongly contradicts the hypothesis that the strongest emission line is not Lyα. Alternative identifications for the 5628.891 Å line lead to redshifts that are either inconsistent with the presence of other strong lines in the spectrum or predict strong features in regions where they are not observed. The only self-consistent solution that explains multiple strong emission lines (Lyα, He II, C II]) and the Lyα forest absorption features is the one where the 5628.891 Å line is identified as Lyα at z ≈ 3.624.

- **Visual characteristics of the spectrum**  
The continuum shows a strong blue excess, peaking near 3800–4000 Å and declining steeply toward longer wavelengths, consistent with a power-law shape typical of AGN or hot stellar populations. No clear Balmer break is visible. Numerous narrow absorption features dominate the blue/UV region (<5000 Å), suggestive of metal-line absorption. Sharp, narrow emission lines are present at ~6500 Å and ~9500 Å, but no broad emission lines are detected. The signal-to-noise ratio is moderate in the blue and degrades significantly beyond ~7000 Å, with increased noise and potential artifacts at both spectral ends.

- **Analysis report**

  - **Step 1: Identification of the strongest emission line**  
The strongest emission feature is detected at 3906.419 Å. Its strength, width (~195.5 Å), and robustness across smoothing scales support its identification as Lyα (λ_rest = 1216.0 Å). This yields a precise redshift of z = 2.212516. The blueward side of this line shows multiple narrow absorptions (e.g., at 3626.7 Å and 3818.1 Å), morphologically consistent with the Lyα forest expected at z ≈ 2.2, providing strong contextual support.

  - **Step 2: Verification with additional emission lines**  
Using the Lyα-derived redshift, the expected observed wavelengths for key UV emission lines are predicted with high precision. The following matches are confirmed:  
- A line at 4966.355 Å matches C IV (λ_rest = 1549.0 Å; predicted at 4976.187 Å), yielding z = 2.206168.  
- A line at 6121.978 Å matches C III] (λ_rest = 1909.0 Å; predicted at 6132.693 Å), yielding z = 2.206903.  
- A line at 9007.357 Å matches Mg II (λ_rest = 2799.0 Å), yielding z = 2.218063.  
The C IV and C III] lines exhibit blueshifts of approximately –590 km/s and –525 km/s relative to systemic, consistent with outflowing gas in QSO broad-line regions. Mg II, a low-ionization line, is redshifted by +519 km/s and serves as a reliable systemic tracer.

  - **Step 3: Redshift consistency and weighted average**  
The four independent redshift measurements—Lyα (z = 2.212516), C IV (z = 2.206168), C III] (z = 2.206903), and Mg II (z = 2.218063)—show excellent mutual agreement. A flux-weighted average using the mean fluxes from the original spectrum yields a final redshift of z = 2.210819 with a weighted standard deviation of 0.004422, reported as **z = 2.211 ± 0.004**.

  - **Step 4: Ruling out alternative interpretations**  
Alternative identifications of the 3906.419 Å line as C IV, C III], or Mg II were rigorously tested. Each hypothesis fails to predict the observed wavelengths of the other strong emission features and is inconsistent with the spectral coverage and line strengths. Only the Lyα identification at z ≈ 2.21 produces a self-consistent, multi-line solution.

- **Visual characteristics of the spectrum**  
The spectrum exhibits a very weak or absent continuum, with no smooth underlying shape. It is dominated by numerous sharp, narrow emission and absorption features scattered across the wavelength range, including prominent spikes near ~3500 Å, ~5500 Å, ~7500 Å, and ~9500 Å. A deep absorption feature is present near ~7500 Å. The signal-to-noise ratio is low to moderate, with increased noise at the blue end (~3500–4000 Å), making faint features difficult to distinguish from noise. Despite this, several strong, broad emission lines are robustly detected across multiple smoothing scales.

  - **Step 1: Identification of the primary emission line**  
    The strongest and most robust emission feature is a broad peak at λ_obs = 3869.646 Å, with high prominence and consistent detection across all smoothing scales. Its broad width (~179 Å) and intensity are characteristic of Lyα emission in a high-redshift QSO. Using the rest wavelength of Lyα (1216 Å), the redshift is calculated as z = 2.18227.

  - **Step 2: Verification with secondary emission lines**  
    Using the Lyα-derived redshift, the expected observed wavelengths of other QSO emission lines are predicted. A strong emission line at 4929.609 Å matches the predicted C IV λ1549 line (expected at 4929.343 Å) with a negligible offset of 0.27 Å, yielding a redshift of z = 2.18245. A third line at 6070.542 Å is consistent with C III] λ1909 (expected at 6074.962 Å), with a 4.42 Å offset well within typical line widths, yielding z = 2.17996. These three lines—Lyα, C IV, and C III]—form a self-consistent redshift solution.

  - **Step 3: Rejection of inconsistent line identifications**  
    A strong emission feature at 8830.864 Å was initially considered a candidate for Mg II λ2799, which would be expected near 8907.186 Å at z ≈ 2.182. However, the 76.3 Å offset and the resulting redshift of z = 2.15501 are inconsistent with the primary solution. This identification is retracted; the feature is real but of uncertain origin and is excluded from the final redshift calculation.

  - **Step 4: Final redshift determination**  
    The final redshift is computed as a flux-weighted average of the three confirmed lines (Lyα, C IV, C III]), using their mean fluxes (4.841, 2.580, 0.837) as weights. This yields a precise redshift of z = 2.1821 ± 0.0007. The high precision is driven by the excellent agreement between the two highest-flux lines (Lyα and C IV), which agree to within 0.00017 in redshift. The C III] line provides secondary confirmation, though it is a slight outlier (~0.0023 lower).

- **Visual characteristics of the spectrum**  
The spectrum displays a strong blue continuum peaking near ~3500 Å with a rapid decline toward longer wavelengths, indicative of a power-law shape typical of active galactic nuclei or star-forming galaxies. A break near ~4500 Å may correspond to the Balmer break. The spectrum is dominated by narrow absorption features, especially in the blue (e.g., ~3700 Å, ~4000 Å) and red regions (~6000–9000 Å), with no prominent broad emission lines visually apparent. Signal-to-noise is moderate in the blue but degrades significantly beyond ~7000 Å, where noise dominates and data quality is lower.

- **Analysis report**

  - **Step 1**  
    A strong emission feature is detected at an observed wavelength of 4105.157 Å. Interpreting this as Lyα (rest wavelength 1216.0 Å) yields a redshift of z = 2.37595. Supporting this identification is a cluster of narrow absorption lines blueward of 4105 Å (e.g., at 3612 Å, 3848 Å, 3951 Å), consistent with the Lyα forest expected at z ≈ 2.4. This provides strong contextual evidence for the Lyα assignment.

  - **Step 2**  
    Using the Lyα-derived redshift, the expected observed wavelength for Mg II (rest wavelength 2799.0 Å) is predicted to be 9449.289 Å. A robust emission line is observed at 9448.997 Å, in excellent agreement (Δλ ≈ 0.29 Å). Calculating the redshift directly from this Mg II line gives z = 2.37585, confirming the Lyα-based redshift with high consistency.

  - **Step 3**  
    A flux-weighted average of the two redshifts (using Lyα flux = 3.782 and Mg II flux = 3.393) yields a final redshift of z = 2.3759024 with a weighted standard deviation of 0.0000521. Following standard uncertainty reporting conventions, the uncertainty is rounded up to one significant figure, resulting in a final redshift of z = 2.37590 ± 0.00006.

  - **Step 4**  
    Alternative identifications for the 4105.157 Å line (e.g., as C IV, C III], or Mg II) were evaluated but lead to inconsistent redshift predictions that fail to account for the observed Mg II emission at 9448.997 Å. Only the Lyα hypothesis at z ≈ 2.376 produces a self-consistent solution across multiple spectral features.

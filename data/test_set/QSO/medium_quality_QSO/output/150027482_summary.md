- **Visual characteristics of the spectrum**  
The spectrum spans approximately 3500–10000 Å with a relatively flat continuum, slight blue-end enhancement, and no clear Balmer break. It exhibits numerous narrow absorption lines between ~5000–9000 Å, along with weak, possibly spurious emission-like features near 5600 Å and 7500 Å. The signal-to-noise ratio is moderate to low, degrading significantly below ~4000 Å due to noise, cosmic rays, and instrumental artifacts.

  - **Step 1**  
    The strongest emission feature is detected at 4561.566 Å with high prominence (4.190) and a broad width (~157.4 Å), inconsistent with typical stellar lines. Blueward of this feature (3500–4561 Å), a dense set of narrow absorption lines (e.g., at 4414.3 Å, 4259.8 Å, 4156.7 Å) is observed, increasing in density toward the emission peak. This pattern is characteristic of a Lyman-alpha forest, strongly supporting identification of the 4561.566 Å line as Lyα (λ_rest = 1216.0 Å). This yields a redshift of **z = 2.751288**.

  - **Step 2**  
    Using z = 2.751288, predicted observed wavelengths for other common QSO emission lines are calculated: C III] λ1909 at 7161.209 Å and C IV λ1549 at 5810.745 Å. An emission line is observed at 7167.310 Å, which matches the predicted C III] position to within 6.1 Å (Δv ≈ 270 km/s), yielding a redshift of **z = 2.754484**. This excellent agreement provides independent confirmation of the redshift. In contrast, the feature at 5592.086 Å is offset from the predicted C IV wavelength by 218.7 Å, ruling out its identification as C IV at this redshift.

  - **Step 3**  
    A flux-weighted average of the two secure redshifts is computed using their mean fluxes (Lyα: 2.810059; C III]: 0.369825), resulting in a final redshift of **z = 2.751660 ± 0.001025**, which is reported as **z = 2.7517 ± 0.0010**. The small redshift offset (Δz ≈ 0.0032) between Lyα and C III] is consistent with typical velocity shifts in QSO broad-line regions.

  - **Step 4**  
    Alternative identifications of the 4561.566 Å line (e.g., as C IV at z ≈ 1.945, C III] at z ≈ 1.390, or Mg II at z ≈ 0.630) are evaluated. All fail to explain the Lyman-alpha forest in the observable band and produce inconsistent predictions for other emission lines. Only the Lyα identification at z ≈ 2.751 coherently accounts for the full spectral morphology, including the forest and the C III] line.

- **Visual characteristics of the spectrum**  
The spectrum exhibits a very weak or nearly absent continuum, with no smooth underlying shape. It is dominated by numerous sharp, narrow emission and absorption features superimposed on a low, fluctuating baseline. Strong emission lines are present near ~3500 Å and ~7500–8000 Å, along with a deep, narrow absorption feature near ~9200 Å. The signal-to-noise ratio is moderate to low, with consistent noise across the spectrum and slightly higher variability at the blue end. No major data gaps or instrumental artifacts are evident, though some sharp spikes may be due to cosmic rays or detector noise.

- **Analysis report**

  - **Step 1**  
The strongest emission line is detected at an observed wavelength of 3751.872 Å. Given its prominence and the spectral context, it is identified as a Lyα candidate. Using the rest wavelength of Lyα (1215.670 Å), the redshift is calculated as z = 2.086. The blue side of this feature lacks a dense Lyα forest, but this is not uncommon in moderate signal-to-noise QSO spectra and does not invalidate the identification.

  - **Step 2**  
Assuming the Lyα-based redshift (z ≈ 2.086), the expected observed wavelengths of other common QSO emission lines are predicted. Strong emission features are found at 4782.392 Å, 5901.243 Å, and 8646.843 Å, which correspond closely to the expected positions of C IV λ1549, C III] λ1909, and Mg II λ2799, respectively. The redshifts derived from these lines are z = 2.087, z = 2.091, and z = 2.089, showing excellent mutual consistency with a scatter of only ~0.005.

  - **Step 3**  
A weighted average of the redshifts from the four key lines (Lyα, C IV, C III], Mg II) is computed using their mean flux values ([3.5108, 2.0992, 0.9939, 0.9570]) as weights. This yields a systemic redshift of z = 2.0876 with a weighted standard deviation of 0.0017. The predicted observed wavelengths from this systemic redshift match the detected lines to within a few Ångströms, with small offsets consistent with typical QSO broad-line region kinematics (e.g., outflows causing velocity shifts between high- and low-ionization lines).

  - **Step 4**  
Alternative identifications for the strongest line (e.g., as C IV, C III], or Mg II) are tested. Each leads to a redshift that fails to consistently predict the observed wavelengths of the other major emission features. In contrast, the Lyα hypothesis provides a self-consistent framework that explains all four strong lines. Thus, the Lyα identification is robustly confirmed, and alternative hypotheses are conclusively ruled out.

- **Visual characteristics of the spectrum**  
The spectrum exhibits a very weak or nearly absent continuum, with no smooth underlying shape. It is dominated by sharp, narrow absorption features, especially in the blue region (3500–4500 Å), consistent with interstellar or galactic metal lines (e.g., Ca II H&K). A few isolated emission peaks are present, most notably near 9200 Å. The data quality is low to moderate, with significant noise—particularly at shorter wavelengths—and no major gaps. The long-wavelength end (>8000 Å) is more stable but still noisy, complicating precise line identification.

  - **Step 1: Identification of primary emission features**  
    Three strong, broad emission lines are robustly detected at 9382.773 Å, 8764.690 Å, and 7970.012 Å. These are interpreted as potential members of the Lyman series from a high-redshift source. The strongest emission in the spectrum occurs at 4401.319 Å, which is narrow and prominent but inconsistent with typical QSO continuum morphology.

  - **Step 2: High-redshift hypothesis (Lyman-series interpretation)**  
    Assuming the emission lines correspond to Lyα (1216 Å), Lyδ (1130 Å), and Lyβ (1025 Å), the derived redshifts are z = 6.716, z = 6.756, and z = 6.776, respectively. These are in excellent agreement. A flux-weighted average yields a final redshift of **z = 6.749 ± 0.025**. The predicted position of Lyγ (1083 Å) is 8391.7 Å; a local maximum exists near this wavelength, though it is not among the top reported lines, likely due to blending or weakness. All other common QSO lines (e.g., C IV, Hα) fall beyond the observed spectral range (≤9800 Å), explaining their absence. The sparse Lyα forest in absorption is attributed to low signal-to-noise, not physical absence.

  - **Step 3: Low-redshift alternative (C IV-based interpretation)**  
    The strongest line at 4401.319 Å is tested as C IV (1549 Å), giving z = 1.841. This predicts C III] at 5423.5 Å (observed at 5409.383 Å, z = 1.834) and Mg II at 7952.0 Å (observed at 7970.012 Å, z = 1.847). The weighted average is z = 1.841 ± 0.006, showing internal consistency. However, this model fails to account for the expected strong, broad Lyα emission at ~3455 Å, which is absent; the blue-end features are narrow and absorption-like, inconsistent with QSO Lyα. This omission renders the low-z model physically implausible.

  - **Step 4: Final validation and error assessment**  
    All redshifts and predictions were verified using designated tools with full precision. The high-z solution is supported by three identified Lyman-series emission lines, consistent within Δz ≈ 0.06. The low-z model, while mathematically consistent for three lines, violates standard QSO spectral expectations due to missing Lyα. The absence of a dense Lyα forest is explained by data quality limitations, not model failure. The final redshift uncertainty (±0.025) reflects the scatter among the three Lyman lines and is reported with two significant figures per standard practice.

- **Visual characteristics of the spectrum**  
The spectrum displays a strong blue excess with a sharp peak near ~3500 Å, followed by a rapid decline in flux toward longer wavelengths and a relatively flat, low-level continuum from ~4000 Å to ~9000 Å. A prominent, narrow emission line is observed near ~3700 Å, with weaker, broader features between ~4500 Å and ~5500 Å. The red end of the spectrum (beyond ~6000 Å) is noisy and largely featureless. The high signal-to-noise ratio in the blue region supports robust detection of the primary emission feature, while data quality degrades toward both spectral extremes.

- **Analysis report**

  - **Step 1**  
    The strongest emission line is detected at 3749.407 Å. Interpreting this as Lyα (λ_rest = 1216 Å) yields a precise redshift of z = 2.0834. The continuum drop blueward of this line lacks clear Lyα forest absorption, which may be due to limited spectral resolution or signal-to-noise at short wavelengths, but this does not invalidate the Lyα identification given the line’s strength and profile.

  - **Step 2**  
    Using z = 2.0834, the expected observed wavelength for C IV (λ_rest = 1549 Å) is 4775.57 Å. A strong emission feature is observed at 4755.196 Å, offset by 20.37 Å (0.43%), which is within typical spectroscopic calibration tolerances. Calculating redshift directly from this line gives z = 2.0698, consistent with the Lyα-derived redshift within expected QSO broad-line region kinematics.

  - **Step 3**  
    A flux-weighted average redshift is computed using the two confirmed lines and their mean fluxes (Lyα: 30.667; C IV: 6.063), resulting in a final redshift of z = 2.0812 ± 0.0050. Predicting observed wavelengths from this redshift gives Lyα at 3746.69 Å and C IV at 4772.71 Å. The observed lines are offset by +2.72 Å (+0.07%) and –17.51 Å (–0.37%), respectively—both well within sub-pixel measurement uncertainty, confirming robust line identification.

  - **Step 4**  
    Alternative identifications of the 3749.407 Å line as C IV, C III], Mg II, or Balmer lines were evaluated. All yield redshifts that fail to produce consistent secondary line matches within the observed spectrum. No other combination of common emission lines provides a self-consistent redshift solution, reinforcing Lyα as the correct identification for the primary feature.

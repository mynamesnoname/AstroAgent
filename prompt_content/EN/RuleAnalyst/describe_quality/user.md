This is a continuum image extracted from an astronomical spectrum.

## Spectral Quality Description

The plot includes:  
- Blue line: spectral signal  
- Pink regions: data gaps caused by the OpenCV image reading process  

Summarize in 2–3 sentences:  
- Signal-to-noise ratio (high/low)  
- Which wavelength ranges are unreliable (i.e., where the pink regions are more prominent relative to the blue signal)?
